# ✈️ Flight Operations Platform — Reference Architecture

> **Sanitized reference architecture** for a cloud-native Flight Operations Platform built on Azure with microservices, real-time event streaming, and ML-enabled decision intelligence.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is a sanitized, illustrative reference architecture for portfolio and educational purposes only. No proprietary systems, internal configurations, IP, or confidential data from any employer are represented here. Technology choices reflect common industry patterns for airline operations platforms.

## 📐 Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](https://ibalajisivarajan.github.io/flight-ops-platform-architecture/flight-ops-architecture.html)
> Open `flight-ops-architecture.html` in a browser for the full interactive diagram.

The platform is organized into **7 horizontal layers**, each independently deployable and domain-isolated:

| Layer | Purpose | Key Technologies |
|---|---|---|
| **Ingestion** | External data feeds & third-party systems | ARINC, ACARS, ADS-B, FAA APIs, REST/SOAP |
| **Streaming** | Event backbone & API integration | Apache Kafka, Azure Event Hubs, Azure API Management |
| **Core Services** | Domain microservices | Python/FastAPI, Java/Spring Boot, .NET Core on AKS |
| **ML / AI** | Predictive models & compliance automation | Azure ML, MLflow, XGBoost, LSTM, Azure OpenAI |
| **Data Platform** | Lake, warehouse & BI | Azure Data Lake Gen2, Snowflake, dbt, Tableau |
| **Observability** | Metrics, logging & tracing | Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk, OpenTelemetry |
| **Security & DevOps** | Zero-trust, CI/CD, governance | Azure AD, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Azure Policy |

## 🧩 Core Microservices

### ✈️ Flight Planning Service
- Route optimization and alternates computation
- Integrates with ML models for fuel-efficient routing
- Exposes both gRPC (internal) and REST (external) interfaces

### ⛽ Fuel Optimization Service
- Predictive fuel uplift recommendations per flight
- Factors: weather, payload, historical burn rates, route type
- Trained ML model (Azure ML Online Endpoint) called at plan generation time

### 👨‍✈️ Crew Management Service
- Duty time tracking and FAR 117 compliance enforcement
- Pairing optimization and disruption re-crewing workflows
- Integrates with HR/scheduling systems via REST APIs

### 🚨 Disruption Management Service
- Real-time IROPS detection from event streams
- Automated recovery scenario generation and ranking
- Stakeholder alert orchestration (ops center, crew, passengers)

### 📡 Passenger Communications Service
- Flight status push notifications at scale (450M+ annually)
- Delay/cancellation messaging via mobile, email, SMS
- Integrates with loyalty and baggage APIs

## 🤖 ML / AI Layer

```
Data Sources → Feature Store → Model Training (Azure ML Pipelines)
                                     ↓
                          Model Registry (MLflow)
                                     ↓
               Online Endpoints → Microservices (real-time inference)
                                     ↓
                    Monitoring (drift detection, retraining triggers)
```

**Models in scope:**
- **Route & Fuel Optimizer** — XGBoost/LSTM trained on historical flights
- **Delay Predictor** — Classification model (4h pre-departure probability)
- **Compliance Checker** — Rules engine + NLP for FAR 117 validation

## 📊 Data Architecture (Medallion Pattern)

```
Bronze (Raw)  →  Silver (Cleansed)  →  Gold (Business-Ready)
   ↓                   ↓                        ↓
All events       Validated, typed         Dimensional model
as landed        deduplicated             (Snowflake / Synapse)
                                                 ↓
                                         Tableau / Power BI
                                         Executive Dashboards
```

## 🔐 Security Design Principles

- **Zero-trust network model** — no implicit internal trust
- **RBAC + just-in-time access** via Azure AD and PIM
- **mTLS** between all microservices (cert-manager + Istio sidecar)
- **Private endpoints** for all data services — no public internet exposure
- **GitOps-driven deployments** — no manual kubectl, all changes via PR
- **Automated compliance gates** in CI/CD pipeline (SAST, container scanning, policy checks)

---

## 🚀 CI/CD & Deployment Pipeline

```
Developer PR
     ↓
GitHub Actions (lint → unit tests → integration tests → container build)
     ↓
Security Gate (Trivy scan, SAST, policy check)
     ↓
ArgoCD sync → AKS Staging (canary deployment)
     ↓
Synthetic monitoring validation (5 min)
     ↓
ArgoCD promote → AKS Production (blue-green cutover)
```
